# Sprint 03 Retrospective

## What went well? 

When we implemented the backend it was originally planned to only implement a shell for a backend but we were able to find packages for Django that make the entire RESTFUL portion of the API work. This allowed setting upt he backend to be more functional than originally planned. 

We were able to add Nuxt and get an idea of how the frontend will be designed

## What didn't go well?

We likely could have accomplished more than the two stories during this sprint.  

We didnt strictly follow the sprint planning recommendations/guide and as such, did not coordinate the sprint effectively. 

## What specific things can you do to improve?

Assign tasks sooner. 

Communicate more.

Ask each other questions if we are unsure about how some portion of the app works.
