# Sprint 03 Retrospective

## What went well? 

We were able to clean up some of the functionality implemented during the last sprint. Including updating the current user endpoint to return more information to improve functionlaity of the site, such as role assignment. 

## What didn't go well?

Like with the other sprints, the actual coordination and planning was not very thorough. This was the result of not familiarizing ourselves with the suggested planning process until the last sprint. 

## What specific things can you do to improve?

RTFM -> Consider Milestone deliverables first rather than considering them to be something to compare against at the end of the sprints.
