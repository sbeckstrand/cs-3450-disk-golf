# Sprint 03 Retrospective

## What went well? 

We accomplished much more during this sprint than during the last. We got most of the major functionality of the application working. including logging in, signing up, frontend page routing, and pages for most components. 

As a team, we developed a better understanding of the how the frontend and backend work with each other. 

## What didn't go well?

Tasks were assigned later than they should have been. 

## What specific things can you do to improve?

Get a better idea of what to work on earlier in the sprint. 

Give each other feedback when appropriate.
