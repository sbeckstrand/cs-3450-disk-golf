# Disk Gol Application Development Plan

## Summary

The overall goal of this project is to create a web applicaiton that allows for managaing and participating in a disk golf tournament. The application will allow for Managers to create and edit tournaments, Sponsors to contribute to the prize pool of a tournament and advertise their business. Players will be able to update their scores and participate in the tournament, as well as order drinks. Drink meisters will be able to track drink orders and their delivery status. 

A related goal is to build the application as a single page application with a focus on simplicity, and minimalism while offering all necessary functionality. 

## Team 

Members: Stephen Beckstrand, Brandon  Hicken, Vinny Smith, and Brandon Stone. 

Responsibilities vary between members with each sprint as we acquaint ourselves with software development responsibilities. 

The team keeps in touch through the use of discord, ocassional in-person meetings, and jira comments. 


## Policies/Procedures

Updates to the repository must be through updating individual branches, using pull requests and having at least one other member on the team review the change before merging to the main branch. 

A different sprint leader is assigned each sprint.

## Risk analysis

### Possible risk sources

### Risk Reduction Strategies

- Keep in constant communication

- Keep others in the know about how you implement functionality to avoid unfamiliarity with code. 
- Meet with Professor/TA regularly to discuss progress and to get feedback. 
- Regular reminder that pond dunking is still on the table.
