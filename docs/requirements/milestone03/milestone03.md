# Milestone 3

## General Notes

For full disclosure, I think our team could have done a much better job at sticking to the structure of coordinating sprints as suggested in this milestone document. Instead, we kind of managed our own planning and processes and didnt really observe the requirements of the milestone until well into our sprints. As such, our planning and discussions have been adjusted to suit the needs for the requirements.
