# Milestone 3

## General Notes

For full disclosure, I think our team could have done a much better job at sticking to the structure of coordinating sprints as suggested in this milestone document. Instead, we kind of managed our own planning and processes and didnt really observe the requirements of the milestone until well into our sprints. As such, our planning and discussions have been adjusted to suit the needs for the requirements. 

## Requirements

### 1. Sprint Planning Documents

As suggested above, we didnt do a very good job at keeping to the sprint planning structure but did hit most of the points when it comes to having a backlog, creating tasks, having a platform to update them etc. As a note, we used JIRA to track our progress instead of using GitHub issues/stories. 

Additionally, prior to generating our burndown charts we neglected to set time estimates and the reports for closed sprints will not update to reflect changes to estimated time. Instead, our burndown charts reflect number of issues over time. 

##### Sprint 3: 

Notes: 

Unfortunately, in JIRA it is not possible to see the previous backlog for an already closed sprint, and we closed it prior to taking a screenshot. Instead, we took a screenshot of the two tasks we had created for this sprint.
