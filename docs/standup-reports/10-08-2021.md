Vinny brought up that we had an upcoming meeting in five days and that we were a bit late to getting a jump on the first sprint of milestone 3. 

Stephen suggested assigning a scrum leader and that we should meet during class periods where there wasnt class. Vinny suggested Stephen should be scrum leader and stephen agreed to do so. 

Brandon S suggested that we should also consider getting together and work on programming an actual page so we can all get on the same page of how it will work and not feel lost. Members discussed their availability and agreed on meeting Oct 15.
