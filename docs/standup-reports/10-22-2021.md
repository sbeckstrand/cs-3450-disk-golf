Vinny brought up an interest in handling the drinks page specifily. 

Vinny brought up that he updated the README as it was missing a step to install packages for Node/Nuxt. 

It was discussed how to get proper responses from the backend and start using that data. Additionally, it was discussed how to create and user a superuser and we discovered an incompatiability with Git Bash in how python was interacting with the manage.py iterface for Django.
